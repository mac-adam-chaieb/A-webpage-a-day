Designing a webpage every day

## Day 1

Playing around with GSS and designing the home page of the project.

Edit. no gonna use GSS lol.

## Day 2

Made [my home page](http://themoechaieb.com) look a little nicer.

## Day 3

Fooled around with [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) a little bit. You can find the webpage [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day3/raphael.html).

## Days 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Exploring the nice [Isomer](http://jdan.github.io/isomer/) library. Decided to build a remake of the 2048, with Isometric graphics: find it at http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day4/index.html.

Probably gonna move it to its own repo soon. It's getting real.

## Day 9

Coming tomorrow!
