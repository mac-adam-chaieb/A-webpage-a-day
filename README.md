Designing a webpage every day

## Day 1

Playing around with GSS and designing the home page of the project.

Edit: not gonna use GSS lol.

## Day 2

Made [my home page](http://themoechaieb.com) look a little nicer.

## Day 3

Fooled around with [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) a little bit. You can find the webpage [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day3/raphael.html).

## Days 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Exploring the nice [Isomer](http://jdan.github.io/isomer/) library. Decided to build a remake of [2048, with Isometric graphics](http://themoechaieb.com/Isometric-2048/index.html).

Probably gonna move it to [its own repo](https://github.com/mac-adam-chaieb/Isometric-2048/) soon. It's getting real.

## Days 10, 11

Took two days off.

## Day 12

Building [a minimal blogging template](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day12/index.html).

## Day 13

Using the [one page scroll plugin](http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/onepage_scroll_demo.html) to make a slide-show page. You can find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day13/index.html).

## Day 14

Re-designed my resume that you can find on my website. I used LibreOffice Writer for the first time.

## Day 15

Oops. Nothing today.

## Day 16

Messing around with Parallax.js, find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day16/index.html)

## Day 17

My favourite day so far. Built a random canvas generator, in the style of Piet Mondrian. It makes you feel a little like an artist. You can find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day17/index.html)

## Day 18

Inspired by last day, I continued to explore some more modern art, mixing it with jQuery this time. Find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day18/index.html). 

If you wonder what this is, just google 'Magritte'.

## Day 19

Made a minimal sample landing page, using jQuery. Find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day19/index.html).

## Day 20

Made a colour generator. Find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day20/index.html).

## Day 21

Woops.

## Day 22

Made a pop-art slideshow. Find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day22/index.html).

## Day 23

Made another, very simple landing page. Used CSS3 for animations, and fooled around with GIMP to modify the background picture. Find it [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day23/index.html).

## Day 24

Coming tomorrow!
