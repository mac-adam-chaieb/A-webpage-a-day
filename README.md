Designing a webpage every day

## Day 1

Playing around with GSS and designing the home page of the project.

Edit: not gonna use GSS lol.

## Day 2

Made [my home page](http://themoechaieb.com) look a little nicer.

## Day 3

Fooled around with [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) a little bit. You can find the webpage [here](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day3/raphael.html).

## Days 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Exploring the nice [Isomer](http://jdan.github.io/isomer/) library. Decided to build a remake of [2048, with Isometric graphics](http://themoechaieb.com/Isometric-2048/index.html).

Probably gonna move it to [its own repo](https://github.com/mac-adam-chaieb/Isometric-2048/) soon. It's getting real.

## Days 10, 11

Took two days off.

## Day 12

Building [a minimal blogging template](http://themoechaieb.com/A-webpage-a-day/day10/index.html), using jQuery.
